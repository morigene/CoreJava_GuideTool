A string is an  object that represent sequence of characters.
Java string class provide method such as compare(), concat(), replace() , equal(), split(),length(), replace(),compareTo(),intern(), substring().
java.lang.String class implements Serializable, Comparable, and CharSequence.


CharSequence is used to represent a  sequence of characters. It is implemented by String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder classes. It means we can create 
in java by using these 3 classes.

Java String is immutable. It can not be changed whenever we create a new string a new instance is created. for mutable string we can use StringBuffer
and StringBuilder Classes.

2 ways to create a string.
________________________________________
1.By literal.
String ory = "MUTUYIMANA Origene"
2.By new keyword.
String s1 = new String("origene");
System.out.println(s1);

Immutable String in Java
___________________________________________
It simply means that is unchangeable, unmodifiable. once string is created it can not change but a new object is created.
ex: 
String ex = "RRA";
ex.concat("RDB");
System.out.println(ex); // can not change because 
there are two object are created but they are still refer to the one.
so we can do like this.
s =s.concat("RDB");
now ouptu is 
System.out.println(s);
